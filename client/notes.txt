Quotes:

"When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is [...] Try not to bash into the walls too much.
Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once
you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than
you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

Once you learn that you'll never be the same again." - Steve Jobs [Jobs 2011]

T-shaped person: "People who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things--the top of the T)
and also experts (among the best in their field withing a narrow discipline--the vertical let of the T)." - Valve handbook for new 
employees
